Inflect Object
=================

Adds inflection functionality to Ruby objects. This is useful if you want to describe things in natural language, for instance Rails objects.


Example
=======

["word"].inflected => "string"
["two", "words"].inflected => "strings"

[Person.new].inflected => "person"
[Person.new, Person.new] => "people"

Person.find(:all) => "people" if Person.count is 0 or >1, "person" otherwise.
